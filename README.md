# Etch-a-sketch
This Project was assigned from the Odin Project and was one of my first completed JavaScript projects.
I'm updating this several months later after cleaning up my files, regardless, I'm happy with the results.

### What I'd Change?

Looking back at this project, I defiently would have designed the page better, it's bland and without much work could be easily improved!

#### Tools Used
  - JavaScript,
  - HTML,
  - CSS
